# o-clock

Just a clock... Nothing else.

This project helps to understand how to work with ticks, datetimes, intervals and any other concept related with time.

## Requirements

- [x] An SVG image (made by yours truly 😉, in [Inkscape][1])
- [x] A realtime clock (also formatted to help where the needles are pointing)
- [x] A typewrite effect, showing random messages.

This project also is under [#100DaysOfImba][2] concerns.

## Additional dependencies

Only [Vite][6] as bundler 😁

## What I learned during the process

1. [K.I.S.S. Principle][3]
2. `autorender` function in [Imba][4] (OMG it's amazing 😍)
3. How the event emitters works in [Imba][4]
4. How to format time (Thanks [MDN][5] 💚).
5. How SVG works in [Inkscape][1]
